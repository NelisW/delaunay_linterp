delaunay_linterp
================

This library performs piecewise linear interpolation over a set of unstructured data points using
Delaunay triangulation.  We use a modified version of the Delaunay triangulation code in [CGAL](http://www.cgal.org/).

Features:
* Incremental insertion of data points
* Adaptive function approximation

The code is released under the GPL v3 license, to comply with CGAL.
